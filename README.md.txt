# Cancer Computational Pipeline

This repository contains a minimal Python-based pipeline for exploratory computational analysis related to cancer research.

## Structure

- `src/` — Core Python modules for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

## Goals

- Learn computational methods for analyzing cancer-related datasets.
- Provide a foundation for future machine learning and AI projects in biomedical research.
- Prepare for summer research opportunities and long-term MD/PhD goals.

## Future Work

- Add real cancer datasets and preprocessing pipelines.
- Implement analysis and visualization functions.
- Extend to machine learning models for prediction or classification tasks.
