## About This Project

This repository is a starter computational pipeline for cancer research data analysis. 
It includes modules for:

- Loading datasets (`data_loader.py`)
- Preprocessing and cleaning data (`preprocessing.py`)
- Performing basic statistical analysis (`analysis.py`)
- Visualizing data (`visualize.py`)
- Placeholder Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`) for experiments

**Purpose:**  
The repo is designed to demonstrate my ability to organize Python code for biomedical data analysis. 
It is research-ready and structured to support future work on real datasets or machine learning projects.
