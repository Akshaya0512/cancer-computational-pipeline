# 🧬 Cancer Computational Analysis Pipeline

A fully modular Python pipeline for exploring open-access cancer genomics datasets (such as TCGA).  
This project is designed for learning data science, machine learning, and computational biology techniques through real, publicly available cancer data.

## 📌 Overview

This repository includes:

- Automatic download of public gene-expression datasets
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Visualization tools for gene expression
- A machine learning classifier for tumor subtype prediction
- A clean, modular code structure suitable for research environments
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step exploration

Although this project uses real cancer data, all datasets are:
- **Public**
- **De-identified**
- **Safe for educational use**
